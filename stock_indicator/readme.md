1. Every month I have money coming in so I want to DCA.
2. I already do some research on stock's foundation. And have a list of stocks that are already in my portfolio.
3. I want to limit my portfolio to 10-30 stocks. Now, each month I will choose to invest in these stocks with limited amount of capital.
4. stock_indicator will provide me signal what stock to buy in that given month.
